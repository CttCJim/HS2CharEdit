# HS2CharEdit

HS2CharEdit is a free, lightweight card editor for Illusions's Honey Select 2 and Ai Shoujo game cards.

Use is relatively simple. To load a card, either click the "Open" icon, or drag a card onto the left panel.

To replace the card's png image with another one, use the image replacement button on the top toolbar.

To revert to the original image, use the revert button next to the image replacer.

To save, use the save icon. This will create a new card with any changes you've made. You may choose to save it as a new file or overwrite the old one.

This app is presented as-is and the author assumes no liability for mishaps.
